# Leaf/Plant Classification using CNN and Sklearn Classifier using UCI Leaf dataset.

# Introduction
Leaf classification is a challenging task due to large
number of different leaf species and there can be lots of similarities
in features for some of those leaves making leaf identification a
tough job. This project implements leaf classification using
different models and then compared results and test accuracies
among those classifiers. After comparing and analyzing their
results, the group members find the good and bad models for leaf
classification.
